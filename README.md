# Oscilloscope Serial

A simple oscilloscope application that reads the values at serial port generated by an Arduino board and based on the value of the analog pin A0

Flash oscilloscope.ino to an arduino board. In the Oscilloscope gui settings select the serial port with correct properties. By default 1000000bps, 8bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow control and an interval of 100us between analog readings. 

You can connect any signal up to 5 volts to the analog pin A0. For signals over 5V a voltage divider is needed.

For ATmega boards it is defined a PWM signal at pin OC1B. To test the Oscilloscope app connect pin OC1B to pin A0
Adjust PWM signal with PWM_FREQ and PWM_DUTY. Default is 100Hz, 50% duty.

Pin OC1B location:
  - Uno, Leonardo: pin 10 (PB2)
  - ATmega2560: pin 12 (PB6)

To build the Oscilloscope app:
- install qt
- cd to src/qt folder
- qmake
- make
